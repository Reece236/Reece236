## PROJECTS

### MLB Pitch Grader (Python/Jupyter Notebook)    (Dec. 2022 ‚Äì Jun. 2023)

‚Ä¢Created expected run value by calculating average run value of pitch result, independent of count

‚Ä¢Handled balls in play by using regression model to predict run value‚Ä¢Fit models with Bayesian Optimization

‚Ä¢Split train and test sets by separating individual pitchers

‚Ä¢Resulted in a positive R2


### [Lineup Simulator (Python/PyCharm)    (Sep. 2021 ‚Äì Apr. 2024)](https://github.com/Reece236/MLB_Sim)

‚Ä¢Created a classification model to predict ball in play outcomes

‚Ä¢Classified outcomes by result and hard hit type, e.g. Single-1, Single-4

‚Ä¢Created outcome distributions for each batter and pitcher‚Ä¢Used brier score minimization to find best pitcher and batter weights

‚Ä¢Used a Markov Chain to predict transitions between states

‚Ä¢O/U accuracy of 56% and correlation of 17% to real scores


### Statcast Based Hitter Tools (Python/Jupyter Notebook)    (Nov. 2023 ‚Äì Nov. 2023)

#### Plate DisciplineoMethodology:

    Pitch Score = (Swing Prob.) * (Swing RV) + (Strike Prob.) * (Strike RV) + (Ball Prob.) * (Ball RV)
  
    Take Score = (Strike Prob) * (Strike RV) + (Ball Prob.) * (Ball RV)
  
  If the player takes pitch:
  
      Swing Score = Take Score ‚Äî Pitch Score
      
  If the player swings:
  
      Swing Score = Swing RV ‚Äî Pitch Score
#### Power

    Predicted bat speed using exit velocity over expected

#### Contact

    Contact over expected
    
  Only evaluated swings
  
  Binary contact or no contact

#### Speed

    Home to first time

#### Tool Based wOBA

    Linear regression using tools, 2022 grade had .18 R2 to true 2023 wOBA
  
  Outperformed xwOBA and wOBA at predicting fututre wOBA
